Hi there! 👋

This repository highlights the 10×30 trade show booth systems we build at AOM Displays.

A 10×30 booth offers one of the most versatile footprints in the industry. With a full 30-ft width to work with, exhibitors can build layered backwalls, create dedicated product areas, add presentation zones, or include a reception front — all within a layout that remains practical to ship, assemble, and reconfigure for future events.

Why Choose a 10×30 Booth?

A 10×30 layout provides:

* Extended visual presence — plenty of space for wide graphics, brand storytelling, and panoramic layouts  
* Flexible zone planning — room for demos, shelving, media displays, sampling counters, or meeting space  
* High-impact front visibility — ideal for crowded aisles or large expo halls where you need strong attention  
* Efficient setup and transport — manageable for small teams without complex hardware or long assembly times  
* Room to scale — supports both simple linear walls and more complex multi-section configurations  

From product showcases to tech presentations, a 10×30 footprint gives you the space to design a booth that truly fits your brand and event goals.

Fully Customizable Layouts

Every brand has different needs, so each 10×30 booth can be configured with:

* Shelving or product display areas
* Media walls or monitor mounting zones
* Reception counters or demo tables 
* Illuminated features for added visual impact
* Open or segmented layouts depending on traffic flow 

If you have a specific concept in mind — even if it's not shown on our website — we can build a custom configuration tailored to your event plan.
